Check for unique values ​​in the `exclusions`, `extras` columns
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT exclusions, extras FROM customer_orders;
```
#### Result set:

- In the `exclusions` and `extras` columns, there are blank spaces and null values.

### Changes:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_orders_temp;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT order_id,
       customer_id,
       pizza_id,
       CASE WHEN exclusions IN ('null', '') THEN NULL
           ELSE exclusions END AS exclusions,
       CASE WHEN extras IN ('null', '') THEN NULL
           ELSE extras END AS extras,
       order_time
FROM customer_orders;

SELECT * FROM customer_orders_temp;
```

#### Result set:

## Table: `runner_orders`

### Original Table:

![Screenshot 2024-03-22 192715](https://github.com/Trantuan24/Project_Sql/assets/145254268/6628dae4-0760-43b5-8805-dd7aeb28adff)

Check for unique values ​​in the `pickup_time`, `distance`, `duration`, `cancellation` columns
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT pickup_time, distance, duration, cancellation FROM runner_orders;
```
#### Result set:
![Screenshot 2024-03-22 192950](https://github.com/Trantuan24/Project_Sql/assets/145254268/60e41aea-d9a1-4ec2-b3f3-16a2eee67122)

- In the pickup_time column, there are null values.
- In the distance column, there are null values. It contains unit - km. The 'km' must also be stripped
- In the duration column, there are null values. The 'minutes', 'mins' 'minute' must be stripped
- In the cancellation column, there are blank spaces and null values.
- Regarding data types, the distance and duration columns must be converted to numbers when removing the unit, and the pickup_time column must be converted to time.

### Changes: 
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_orders_temp;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
    order_id,
    runner_id,
    CAST(CASE WHEN pickup_time = 'null' THEN NULL
       ELSE pickup_time END 
        AS DATETIME) AS pickup_time,
    CASE WHEN distance = 'null' THEN NULL
       ELSE CAST(regexp_replace(distance, '[a-z]+', '') AS FLOAT) END AS distance,
    CASE WHEN duration = 'null' THEN NULL
       ELSE CAST(regexp_replace(duration, '[a-z]+', '') AS FLOAT) END AS duration,
    CASE WHEN cancellation IN ('null', '') THEN NULL
       ELSE cancellation END AS cancellation
FROM runner_orders;

SELECT * FROM runner_orders_temp;
```
